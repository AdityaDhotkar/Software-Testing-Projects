 💻 Project 3: API Testing (Node.js Custom Server)
Description:
I developed a dummy REST API using Node.js and Express to simulate backend responses. This demonstrates my ability to understand code and test APIs.

⚙️ How to Run This Project:
1. Navigate to the folder: `03_API_NodeJS_Server`
2. Open terminal/command prompt.

Collection: A Postman Collection .json file is included in the folder.

Tests Performed:

GET Request: Verify Status 200 OK & JSON Body.

Data Validation: Checked if user data matches the source data.json.

Response Time: Verified performance under 200ms.

🔧 Tools & Skills
Manual Testing: Test Plans, Test Cases (Excel), Bug Life Cycle.

API Testing: Postman, Status Codes, JSON validation.

Technical: Basic Node.js, Git, GitHub.
